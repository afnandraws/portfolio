				In my capacity as Vice President of "Drugs and Alcohol Awareness," I was
				instrumental in organizing and conducting "Transcending Taboo," a
				groundbreaking week-long conference. This unique event brought together
				individuals with diverse perspectives on drug use and addiction,
				providing a platform for open dialogue and knowledge exchange. The
				conference featured renowned speakers such as David Nutt, a trailblazer
				in psychedelic research, and Neil Woods, whose experiences as an
				undercover cop shed light on the complexities of drug enforcement.
				<br />
				<br />
				In my role as a Graphic Designer, I specialized in creating impactful
				marketing collateral. Leveraging Adobe Illustrator, I meticulously
				designed brochures, flyers, posters, and business cards <br />
				My role involved not only logistical coordination but also the creation
				of materials that facilitated these important conversations.
				<br />
				<br />
				Our mission was clear: to keep students safe by promoting safe drug use
				rather than advocating for a complete abstention from drugs. This
				approach allowed us to engage with our audience on a practical and
				realistic level, fostering a culture of responsibility and informed
				decision-making.
